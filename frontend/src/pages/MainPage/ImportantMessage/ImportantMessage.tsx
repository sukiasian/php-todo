		<h2>Important announcement:</h2>
		<p>The aim of this project was to learn PHP in 1 day. I managed to get from theory to practice in Laravel within 14 hours overall. This project has obvious design issues, as well as optimization and security issues. However, as it was said before, the goal was to build something on PHP rather than run for design and all other stuff. Most of my projects are optimized, as well as secure and protected. The code here is also not clean - I had to trade-off between functionality and optimized code.</p>
